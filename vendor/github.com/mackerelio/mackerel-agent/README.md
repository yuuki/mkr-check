![agent-si](docs/images/agent-si.png "mackerel-agent")

mackerel-agent is a piece of software which is installed on your hosts to collect metrics and events and send them to [Mackerel](https://mackerel.io/) where they can be visualized and monitored.

mackerel-agent executes the following tasks in the foreground:
- registering your hosts with Mackerel
- collecting specs and metrics from your hosts and posting them to Mackerel

Your hosts' information will be viewable on [Mackerel](https://mackerel.io/).

As of now, mackerel-agent is officially supported to run on Amazon Linux, CentOS 5/6/7, Ubuntu 12.04LTS/14.04LTS, Debian 6/7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 and later 32-bit/64-bit environments.

SYNOPSIS
--------

Build and Run the mackerel-agent.

```
make build
make run
```

The `apikey` will be required in order to run the agent.

An organization must first be created in [Mackerel](https://mackerel.io/), then the `apikey` can be configured in `mackerel-agent.conf`.

The following commands can be used instead of `make`.

```
go get -d github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent
go build -o build/mackerel-agent \
  -ldflags="\
    -X github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent/version.GITCOMMIT `git rev-parse --short HEAD` \
    -X github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent/version.VERSION   `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 | sed 's/^v//' | sed 's/\+.*$$//'` " \
  github.com/mackerelio/mackerel-agent
./build/mackerel-agent -conf=mackerel-agent.conf
```

To build on Windows use the command ```build.bat```

To run on Windows use the command ```run.bat```
