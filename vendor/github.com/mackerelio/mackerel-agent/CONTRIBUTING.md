Contribution Guide
==================
We love contributions in the form of pull requests!
If you fixed or added something useful to the project, you can send pull-request.
Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

Please make sure you add a test for your change and all tests are passed. (`make test`)
